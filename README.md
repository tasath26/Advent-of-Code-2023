# Advent-of-Code-2023

This is my attempt at the 2023 advent of code puzzles in Javascript.
I have not touched Javascript in my life so the code here is EXTREMELY BAD,
but regardless, it's a very fun way to learn.

Workload is huge rn so i'll add the rest of the days when i actually have the time to do them.
